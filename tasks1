Need More clarification CR's:

2.	For Citizenship = Poland  do not show the field “Country of Birth”

--Is it applicable for both poland and romania applications?
--If poland is citizenship, then what value we need to put for country of birth?
--do we need to empty the country of birth field while?


3.	Attach documents
The below entry - hide field, don't remove

--Based on the checkbox checked we are allowing the user to submit
--If we hide the field we need to remove the validation logic

--hide means - is it based on rulesheet or just hide from UI?
--hiding the checkbox alone or the text also?
need ask osama to hide the field in rulesheet.


5.	Attach documents . Please remove “Country” 

--Based on the country selection we are showing the mobile number field and ISD code field in the seperate boxes
--If we remove the country how should we show the mobile number field with or without seperate ISD field?
--based on that we need to change the input field length also.
